                Trump, Tariffs, Toil and Trouble

                From Shakespeare’s Macbeth, a group of witches huddle around a pot, speaking in an occult tongue, creating a charm for chaos. I never saw or read Macbeth, but I needed something with oil and t, which came toil, and then trouble.

                One of my goals is to keep myself accountable with economic and political events, using my degree while I study to become an actuary. On June 17-18, 2025, the Federal Reserve Board (FED) had its monthly meeting. They reported positive economic signs:
              </p>
              
              <ul>
                <li>Predicted GDP growth of 2%</li>
                <li>Unemployment rate at 4%</li>
                <li>Inflation at 2%</li>
                <li>Federal funds rate set to be maintained at 4.25–4.50%</li>
              </ul>
              
              <p>
                Total neutrality, a positive sign. On June 21, 2025, Trump bombed Iran, citing a mandatory ceasefire.
              </p>

            <p>
                To assess the potential damage in the coming months, two key components must be considered: GDP and tariffs. But what is GDP? Gross Domestic Product, at its most basic level, measures the total value of consumable output produced, adjusted for real dollar value. Why is this important? Tariffs directly affect both production and consumption, making GDP a critical metric for understanding the broader economic impact.
            </p>

	        <p>
                GDP = Consumption + Investment + Government Spending + (Exports - Imports) 
            </p>

	        <p>
                If you never took an economics class, investment isn’t what you think it is. The only variable to focus on in this blog is net exports (exports - imports). 
            </p>

	        <p>
                What exactly are Trump’s tariff policies?  Besides my asian skincare products getting taxed more, it’s about the wider economic effect and how Trump came up with his equation.
            </p>

            <p>
                Here is a screenshot of the tariff equation provided by the USTR.gov site.

                And another screenshot for my helpful diagram,
            </p>

            <img src = blog3/diagram.png>

            <p>
                To summarize this entire thing with my bachelor’s degree in business economics, the tariff equation is just:
            </p>

            <img src = blog3/tariff.png>

            <p>
                The variable that alarmed me the most is epsilon, the e-looking symbol. This is the elasticity of imports with respect to import prices, represented as a constant less than 0 (so negative).
            </p>

            <p>
                The variable that alarmed me the most is epsilon, the e-looking symbol. This is the elasticity of imports with respect to import prices, represented as a constant less than 0 (so negative).
              </p>
              
              <p>The rules of elasticity in terms of economics can be noted as:</p>
              
              <ul>
                <li>If it’s between 0 and 1, you are more inelastic, i.e., less likely to buy less if prices were to increase. Think gas, medicine, electricity, bread.</li>
                <li>If it’s greater than 0, you are elastic, i.e., more likely to buy less if prices were to increase. Think clothes, games, rave tickets.</li>
                <li>Elasticity with respect to prices is almost always negative. No sound consumer would buy more of something when the price goes up.</li>
                <li>Elasticity with respect to another good can be positive or negative, but that affects demand and supply, not prices.</li>
              </ul>
              
              <p>
                So, if we have an inelastic product, that value is between 0 and 1, and it’s in the denominator of the equation. Imagine, in one scenario, that you are heavily dependent on this product, represented as 1/50, then the tariff change results in a positive increase of 50.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                In Q1 2025, the FED reported -1,267 billion dollars in net exports (FRED). That’s a lot of imports. Oil is one of the most inelastic products and made up about 18% of total imports in 2023 (EIA), and we import from Canada, Mexico, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, and Brazil (EIA).
              </p>
              
              <img src = blog3/FED.webp>

              <p>
		So if we're inelasticity dependent on imported oil, and there's a proportional increase in tariffs on that oil, who pays for this? It's not the sellers who are.
              </p>

                On Saturday, June 21, 2025, Trump issued an attack on Iran, bombing nuclear sites in Fordo, Natanz, and Isfahan. This was in retaliation for Iran defending itself from Israel after being bombed. The US has now inserted itself into a war; the cauldron has bubbled over.
              </p>

              <p>
                Iran has now voted to close the Strait of Hormuz on June 22, 2025, which holds ⅕ of the entire global oil supply. The next few months will be sensitive, crucial, and will have me on the edge of my seat.
